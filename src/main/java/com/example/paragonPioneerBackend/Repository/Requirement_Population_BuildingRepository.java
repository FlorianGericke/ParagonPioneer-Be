 * requirement-population-building relationships, along with providing pagination and sorting
 * capabilities inherited from the JpaRepository interface. The
 * {@link Requirement_Population_Building} entity defines the necessary population requirements
 * for buildings, establishing a crucial part of the application's data model related to
 * urban planning or management simulations.
 *
 * As part of the application's data access layer, this repository abstracts the underlying
 * data storage mechanism, enabling straightforward access and manipulation of
 * requirement-population-building relation data without directly dealing with database queries.
