# Back-End Documentation
This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the back-end environment for our application. It outlines the requirements, steps to set up the database, and instructions to run the application.
## Requirements
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- **Java** 17: Required for running the application.
- **Gradle**: Used for building and running the application.
- **MySQL 8.1.0** or **Docker**: MySQL for database management, Docker for containerization. Rancher can be used as an alternative for Docker.

## Setting Up the Back End

### Database Setup

You have two options for setting up the database: using a local MySQL server or Docker.

#### Using Docker
To create and start the Docker environment, execute:
    
```bash
  make dev_enviroment
```

To stop the Docker environment:

```bash
 make stop_dev_enviroment
```

To reset the Docker environment to its initial state:


```bash
 make rebuild_dev_enviroment
```

#### Using Local MySQL Server

1. Ensure MySQL is installed and running.

2. Configure the application to connect to your database by editing src/main/application.properties with the following settings:

The file should look like this:

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/ppAssemblyLineBa
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=password
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect


### Running the Application

After setting up the database, you can start the application using one of the following methods:

 - Using **Gradle**: Execute the command `gradle bootRun` in your terminal.
 - Using an **IDE**: Run the `main method in java/com/example/paragonPioneerBackend/PpApiApplication.java`.

#### With Docker
To run both the database and application using Docker, execute:

```bash
    make prod_enviroment
```

### 3. Access the Application

Now that the application is running, you can access it via the following URL:

[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

All available endpoints are listed here. You Should be able to use all GET Requests without any problems.
For POST, PUT and DELETE requests, you will need to authenticate yourself. To do this, you can use the following credentials:

    email: admin@user.de
    password: admin

These Credentials are only for testing purposes. In a real application, you would need to create your own user and request 
Admin Access from the Owner of the Application.
